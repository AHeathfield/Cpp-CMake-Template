# Cpp-CMake-Template
This is my CMake template for my C++ projects. It has some examples and explanations. Nothing professional here, I learned a bit of CMake and just wanted to have a template I can add to when I come across certain issues.

## Setting Up Build Directory
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
## Whenever you need to recompile
- *Make sure current path is in build*
```bash
cmake --build .
```
